# gravity-sim
Simulation of gravitational forces applied on planet-like bodies  

## Commands
Left click on the scene to create a new planet, hold to adjust the size from min to max, release to spawn  
While holding left click, it's possible to also right click to reset the size before spawning  

## Comparison
The comparison main is a way to visualize the three body problem and the chaos theory: the demonstration shows that even for very similar initial condition of two systems of 3 planets, given enough time those systems will diverge and become wildly different; one can therefore deduce that for any system observed at a certain time it would be impossible to imply the initial conditions that generated them
